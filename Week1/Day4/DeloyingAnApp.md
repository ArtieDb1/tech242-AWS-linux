# Deploying an app

## Aim
Today the aim is to use a new VM to deploy our first app.
Before starting, we need not create a new ec2 instance so if you dont know how to do that, please see the content of day 2. The difference today will be the security groups used on our new VM will allow any IP address to access certain ports within the VM.

- [Automating the installation of plugins](#aim)
- [Copying Files from our local machine to the VM](#aim)

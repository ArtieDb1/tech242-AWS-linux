## Introduction
When someone uses a machine, there is data that is stored that can be accessed and read by you, a user. This storage can be internal (within your computer) or  external (USB stick, or external HDD). The benefit of external storage is your data being persistent and accessable  long after the dreaded demise of your PC.

With so many ways of storing data, it raises a question as to how practical it can be to continuously store data on external devices everytime you use up all of the storage that you have. This is where cloud computing helps.

In this README file, I will briefly exlain what the cloud is and detail further about its capabilities

## What is the Cloud
Cloud storage is another way of storing your data. When you want to store data but you don't have the physical resorces to store so much data, a company that owns a data warehouse can house your data for you. These data warehouses are located around the world and act as a store of all of your data. Data warehouses can all communicate together to provide us all with different services and there are many companies that offer cloud storage notably Google, Apple and Amazon.

## History of cloud
As previously discussed, the cloud is a way of storing data. Data storage goes as far back as the 50's with the vonn Neeuman machine storing numbers for simple calculations. We have since moved to faster, smaller and more efficient ways of storing data ultimately leading us to today where cloud storage is our most persistent form of data storage.
With the cloud, applications are often stored there and provided as different services. Previously, for applications to be provided, peopole relied on client server computing to download different files. This then became distributed computing which allowed a computer with certain resources to share its resources with other computers within a network. Recently weve allowed the cloud to store all of the services nd resources that we need.
Here we can see that the cloud is a very powerful tool that allows people to work with applications without needing to store large piles of data on their local machine.

## Uses of Cloud
There are 4 models of cloud computing
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- platform as a service (PaaS)
- software as a service (SaaS)
  -  Creation of applications that can be sold as a service for a subscription 
- serverless computing.

## What are the different types of cloud service?

Advantages
- external storage of applications and data
- efficient way of providing applications to users

Disadvantages
- Less control of your data
+ privacy concerns
+ servers can go offline

## OPEX vs CAPEX
In the context of cloud computing, OpEx (Operational Expenditure) and CapEx (Capital Expenditure) are terms used to distinguish different cost structures associated with using cloud services.

OpEx (Operational Expenditure):

In the cloud, operational expenses are related to ongoing, variable costs that you incur while using cloud services. These are similar to day-to-day expenses.
OpEx in the cloud includes pay-as-you-go fees for services used, such as computing power (like virtual machines), storage, network usage, and other resources.
Since you pay for what you use on a recurring basis (like monthly or hourly billing), it's treated as operational expenses similar to utility bills.
CapEx (Capital Expenditure):

Capital expenditure in the context of the cloud involves upfront investment in infrastructure or resources with a longer-term benefit.
For example, if you decide to purchase reserved instances or commit to using a certain level of resources for a specified period in advance, that initial payment could be considered CapEx.
It's akin to purchasing hardware or software licenses outright, but in the cloud, it might refer to commitments or prepayments for cloud resources that provide cost benefits over time.

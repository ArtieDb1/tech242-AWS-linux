# Project
The aim of this project was to deploy an application that would handle the task of initiating a 2 tier deployment.

## What is a 2 teir deployment
Two tier deployment is when there are 2 clear components that handle different parts of an app's functionality. We want to deploy certain components of an apps functionality and there will be different VMs for each component.

There are usually 3 tiers:
Application Layer – Layer that the user interacts with 
Logic Layer – A layer that translated the user's input to commands understood by a computer
Data layer – A layer that stores data that a user may want to request

## Task 
Complete a 2 tier deployment of an app that connects to a databse. The database has some information on it about countries. We want one Virtual macine to have an app interface and another VM to hold the database.

## Plan 
Start a VM that runs in Linux
Get the code that runs the app running on that VM.
Download all dependencies needed for that code to run
Test that its Running 
Automate
